## 📘 Overview
This project demonstrates **Machine Fault Detection** using AI on IBM Cloud. The solution involves uploading a dataset to IBM Watson Studio, cleaning the data, and building a notebook-based prediction system using Python and machine learning techniques.

It was completed as part of the **IBM SkillsBuild Internship Program** with a focus on **AI + Cloud Integration**.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
To build a smart system that analyzes machinery data and detects faults automatically using historical sensor data. The AI model should predict machine conditions based on inputs like temperature, pressure, and vibration.

---

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- IBM Watsonx.ai / IBM Cloud
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- Machine Learning (Classification)
- VS Code (for local testing)
